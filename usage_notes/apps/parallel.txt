# Run commands in parallel
# 'commands' refer to normal commands that can be executed from the terminal

# ]$ parallel COMMAND ::: ARG1 ARG2   # Will run 'COMMAND ARG1' and 'COMMAND ARG2' in parallel.
parallel echo ::: asdf qwer zxcv

# ]$ parallel ::: COMMAND1 COMMAND2   # Will run COMMAND1 and COMMAND2 in parallel.
parallel ::: 'echo hello' pwd

# ]$ parallel COMMAND ::: ARG1A ARG1B ::: ARG2A ARG2B   # Run arg combinations in parallel (COMMAND ARG1A ARG2A, ...)
parallel echo ::: asdf qwer zxcv ::: 111 222 333

# Same as above, but not as many combinations (hard to explain, just run and see for yourself)
parallel --link echo ::: asdf qwer zxcv ::: 111 222 333
parallel echo ::: asdf qwer zxcv :::+ 111 222 333
