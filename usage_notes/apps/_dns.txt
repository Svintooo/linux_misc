## How linux apps do name resolution
1. GNU libc
 caveat: can only lookup A and AAAA
 functions:
  - resolver()       # low level, BSD spec
  - gethostbyname()  # old, obsolete POSIX spec
  - getaddrinfo()    # new, modern POSIX spec
 files:
  - /etc/nsswitch.conf
  - /etc/hosts        # through nsswitch.conf
  - /etc/resolv.conf  # through nsswitch.conf
  - /etc/hostname     # through nsswitch.conf
2. Custom
 reasons:
  - performance
  - look up other records than A and AAAA

## how to use them yourself
# GNU libc
getent hosts <host-name>
getent ahosts <host-name>

# Custom: Only DNS servers
host
dig
drill
